# Overview

To further explore lists, we will look at RecyclerView. This is a new list widget and is the default way now to build lists.

It was designed to overcome feature bloat in ListView and to enforce good practices. The long story (about 45 minutes) can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LqBlYJTfLP4.

In order to use RecyclerView, it will need to be imported to your project. This can be done for you in the Layout view by clicking the arrow next to RecyclerView in the Palette, or you can add it directly to the module Gradle file.

```
    implementation 'androidx.recyclerview:recyclerview:1.1.0'
```
